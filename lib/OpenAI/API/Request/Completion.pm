=head1 NAME

OpenAI::API::Request::Completion - completions endpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

=over 4

=item * model

ID of the model to use.

See L<Models overview|https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview>
for a reference of them.

=item * prompt

The prompt for the text generation.

=item * suffix [optional]

The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

=item * max_tokens [optional]

The maximum number of tokens to generate.

Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest
models, which support 4096.

=item * temperature [optional]

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like
0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will
make it more focused and deterministic.

=item * top_p [optional]

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling.

We generally recommend altering this or C<temperature> but not both.

=item * n [optional]

How many completions to generate for each prompt.

Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for
C<max_tokens> and C<stop>.

=item * stop [optional]

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

=item * frequency_penalty [optional]

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based
on their existing frequency in the text so far.

=item * presence_penalty [optional]

Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based
on whether they appear in the text so far.

=item * best_of [optional]

Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the
one with the highest log probability per token).

Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for
C<max_tokens> and C<stop>.
